        Need for Speed: The Run is a racing video game and the eighteenth title in the Need for Speed series. Published by Electronic Arts, it was released on November 15, 2011, with multiple versions - EA Black Box developed versions for PlayStation 3, Windows, and Xbox 360; Firebrand Games developed versions for the 3DS, and Wii. An iOS version was planned to be developed by EA Mobile, but it was eventually cancelled. The game focuses on point-to-point races involving overtaking opponents, defeating rivals, time attacks, and evading the efforts of both police and criminal gang members to stop them.

        Unlike previous entries in the series, The Run features an extensive collection of races set against real-life locations, including the cities of New York, Chicago, Las Vegas, and San Francisco, and features a wide variety of real-life cars to drive in. The game's career mode sees players assume the role of street racer taking part in a large-scale race from San Francisco to New York and seeking to win it against various odds. While the game received extensive marketing and heavy promotion from its developers, it received mixed reviews from critics following its release.

        Up to eight players can participate in a single online match. Players are able to party with friends, pick a playlist of their favorite challenges and compete for supremacy across every stage of game. In addition to this, players never have to wait in a lobby again even if they are joining a race in progress.[11] The multiplayer matches are split into differing game type playlists, such as Supercar Challenge, NFS Edition Racing, The Underground, Mixed Competition, Exotic Sprint, and Muscle Car Battles. Most of these modes pertain to different car varieties for each race, but the Supercar Challenge is meant entirely for the fastest cars on the fastest tracks. The player can select an event and vote towards the race course where the multiplayer game should be taking place on. Players also take part in a reward system known as "The Bonus Wheel", which randomly selects a reward and required goal criteria for it.

        The game is similar to Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit. Players race down freeways until they meet a police car. The police then try to chase them down and wreck their car. They also encounter other objectives such as a straight-up race. There is another mode where players 'duel' a rival. They can also race to toll booths that double as checkpoints.[1]

The 3DS version also features Autolog, which is integrated throughout the career mode and uses 40 in-game challenges scattered throughout the campaign. The game also takes advantage of StreetPass, letting players upload their best Autolog scores to other Nintendo 3DS devices. In multiplayer, the game features a straight race mode where eight people compete. There is also a four-on-four Cops vs. Racers mode. The game supports Wi-Fi and local wireless connections.[1] However, the Wii version lacks online play, yet it has split-screen multiplayer.
